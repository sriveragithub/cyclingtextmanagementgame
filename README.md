Key Components:
Management based game with participation in races
Management in the sense that you can hire/fire/trade riders, sign sponsors, 
Participation in races will be text-based with decisions to attack, sit in, posture in group, etc...
Races will factor in some system for energy, rider strengths/weaknesses, ideally should last about 5 minutes or so

Race-side:
Options will be attack, watch rider, follow teammate, sit in, move to front of peloton, lead peloton (chase), 
AI system will have to take into account strategy; i.e. if opposition sitting in, does AI lead peloton or sit in as well? If
